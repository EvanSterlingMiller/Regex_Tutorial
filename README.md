## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors signify the position in a string where a match must occur. When an anchor is used in a search expression the regular expression engine does not advance throught string or consume any of the characters The anchor looks for a match at that specific position. 
Types of anchors:
 ^   Match must occur at the begining of the string, or at the begining of the line
 $   Match must occur at the end of the string or the end of a line
 \A  Match must occur at the begining of the string only
 \Z  Match must occur at the end of the string or before \n at the end of the string
 \z  Match must occur at the end of the string only
 \G  Match ust start at the position where the previous match ended, of there was no previous match, the position in the string where the matching started.
 \b  Match must occur on a word boundary
 \B Match must not occur on a word boundry
